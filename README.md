# Fast Food Billing System
The traditional fast food billing system lacks many features that can be implemented to improve its usability and mobility. By analyzing the concurrent fast-food billing system, we found couple of problems within which needs to be minimized. Fast-food billing system is a system which helps to manage the order, processes along with billing of a restaurant. Customers place their orders and the restaurant staffs process them in the system and act thereby. This system consists of some problem and those are addressed below:

1. In the current system, customers must wait in long queue to place their order as there is only one centralize software placed in the counter CPU. So, they have to take order one by one which kills customers valuable time.

2. This system cannot take multiple order concurrently. i.e. One needs to order two burgers having separate billing. This system has to input orders one by one so it will be less efficient.

3. Traditional billing system software is not associated with the current kitchen update. If any food item is not available anymore, then the billing system will not automatically get updated rather they have to know manually to identify the remaining food items.

4. Top online food purchasing apps are not connected to our current billing system so if anyone has to order through another medium like Foodpanda or Shohoz food, the delivery boy needs to come in the restaurant and has to place the order in person which lack professionalism.

5. Some existing billings system somehow may store data locally but that bears to much risk of getting data removed by any kind of software or hardware crash.
